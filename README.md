# PZT_Data_Structure
Description: The project is created for pzt learning data structure. Some code about data structure will be updated in this project. The code might be vulnerable at first and be optimized step by step.

Target List: 
1.Red-Black Tree: basic structure, rotate, fix-up function, insert, delete

[2021-07-06][RedBlackTree]
1.update the delete function
2.it will show if the tree is satisfied with rule2(root is black), rule4(two red nodes cannot be neighboring) and rule5(for every node, the quantity of black node of right child and left child are equal)
3.add fix-up function for deleting, so that deleting nodes would not influence the tree

[2021-07-05][RedBlackTree]
1.add delete node function without fix-up

[2021-07-04][RedBlackTree][2]
1.Add functions for RBTreeNode to find the relationship between the node and its parent
2.When a RBTreeNode convert to string, it will show the significant information of the node
3.When deleting a normal node(not none node), the attributes of it will be set to none
4.Finish left/right rotate function and fix-up function
5.The node can be insert into a tree that can fix up itself
6.The tree can be show in different order
7.Provide a function to get the depth of the tree

[2021-07-04][RedBlackTree]
1.Define RBTree and RBTreeNode.
2.RBTreeNode has implemented some basic function.
3.Define Nil Node(key is none), the attribute of Nil Node cannot be set
